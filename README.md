- *High-Score Tracking:* Compete against yourself and others by striving for top scores that persist even after power cycles.

- *Customizable Settings:* Tailor the game to your liking by adjusting rounds, reaction time thresholds, and other aspects.

## Game Modes

### Single Player Mode

Sharpen your reflexes and challenge yourself in single-player mode. Face a series of randomly generated LED sequences, testing your ability to respond swiftly and accurately.

### Multiplayer Mode

Engage in friendly rivalry with a friend in multiplayer mode. Compete head-to-head with separate sets of LEDs and switches, and determine who has the quickest reflexes.

## Difficulty Levels

### Easy Mode

An ideal starting point for newcomers. The game sets a comfortable pace, allowing players to familiarize themselves with the gameplay mechanics.

### Medium Mode

A balanced challenge suitable for players looking to refine their reflexes. The LED sequences become slightly faster, demanding quicker responses.

### Hard Mode

For the ultimate challenge seekers. The LED sequences speed up significantly, requiring lightning-fast reactions to keep up with the game.

## Visual Feedback

Celebrate your success with visual cues. Swift and accurate responses trigger flashing LEDs or special messages like "Perfect!", adding a sense of accomplishment to your gameplay.

## Multiplayer Mode

Challenge a friend to a reaction time showdown! Multiplayer mode lets each player use their own set of LEDs and switches. The segment display acts as a scoreboard, showcasing reaction times and declaring a winner.

## Score Tracking

Compete against yourself and others by aiming for high scores. The game keeps track of top scores, motivating you to beat your previous records and achieve new milestones.

## Customizable Settings

Make the game your own with customizable settings. Adjust the number of rounds, set reaction time thresholds, and personalize other aspects to match your preferences.
